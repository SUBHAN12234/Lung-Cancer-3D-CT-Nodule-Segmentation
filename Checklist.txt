Lung Nodule Detection Project â€” Checklist

Setup & Environment
- [x] Clone GitHub repository 
- [x] Create and activate Python virtual environment
- [x ] Install required libraries
- [x] Generate and commit requirements.txt

Data Preparation
- [x] Download and organize LIDC-IDRI dataset
- [ ] Explore dataset: patients, nodules, image formats
- [ ] Preprocess images:
    - [ ] Normalize or resize CT slices if needed
    - [ ] Convert 2D slices into 3D volumes per patient/nodule
- [ ] Process masks:
    - [ ] Verify masks presence correspond to nodules
    - [ ] Create binary labels: "nodule present" vs "no nodule"

Model Development
- [ ] Define problem: Input = 3D CT volume; Output = binary label (nodule or no nodule)
- [ ] Select and implement a suitable 3D CNN model architecture for binary classification
- [ ] Train model on labeled data
- [ ] Evaluate model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Experimentation & Optimization
- [ ] Tune hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs)
- [ ] Try data augmentation on 3D volumes (rotation, flipping)
- [ ] Test different model architectures if possible
- [ ] Validate results with cross-validation or hold-out test set

Results & Analysis
- [ ] Visualize some sample predictions and masks
- [ ] Analyze false positives and false negatives
- [ ] Document model performance metrics and insights

Documentation & Finalization
- [ ] Write clear README (project goals, setup, usage)
- [ ] Add code comments and explanations
- [ ] Save final trained model and scripts
- [ ] Prepare report or presentation summary
